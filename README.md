YAML schema on swagger for Chelf

This repository contains the schema for the proposed API called "Chelf" as part of the value added program conducted at VIT.

"There is no sincere love than the love of food"

This saying by playwright George Bernard Shaw can be considered the inspiration behind this application. Everyone likes having their favourite food from their favourite chefs, many people also dont mind experimenting with new dishes while some people want to try all there is the world has to offer. Often, exotic and foreign dishes are sold at higher prices. The other choice would be to find the best restaurant in your city for a particular dish and travelling there everyday. Otherwise you order food which again is not fresh and may not taste exactly the best. Using chelf you can choose a dish from around the world by any chef and get it delivered to you. Now here's what is new, the package delivered to you will be a bunch of ingredients curated for easy usage, dish secrecy and contain the exact quantity required to cook the food. The customers then can prepare the dish using the ingredients by following a simple guide. This will enable the food cooked to be fresh and authentic. The pricing of food also is something which sets chelf apart as local  ingredients cost less and foreign ingredients cost slightly higher.To make it clear given below are a few scenarios:

### Scenario 1
You want to have pasta by a particular chef from Rome. Yes, you can folllow one of his food shows but you need to go out and find all the ingredients required. Since you are in India, all the local spices and ingredients mentioned may not be availible, even if they are, they might not be the exact quality also foreign spices usually are more expensive. Lets assume you got your ingredients now cooking with the exact quantity and mix is difficult and as the spices may not be the same, you might end up with something else. 
#### 
If you order the same dish through chelf, your dish will cost you based on your location and ingredients hence it will cost you higher than it costs in Rome but it would be much cheaper than going around and looking for these spices as Chelf would have these spices in bulk all around the world. The cooking itself would be simple as you will find many ingredients already mixed in proportions to make your task easier and preserve secrecy of some dishes. You can cook and enjoy your meal which would be as close to the authentic pasta as it can get.
### Scenario 2
You are an Indian in Japan and crave your favourite Indian curry. You, in this case are'nt the greatest of cooks and have no one who can cook for you. You can visit an Indian restaurant    but it is pretty far from your place and you can't afford going there everyday. 
#### 
In this case you can order the curry from chelf. Now to save money you can choose a basic chef and proceed ordering your ingredients. The ingredients would be priced based on your location that is Japan hence cost slightly higher than local. Your food will be delivered and you can cook it as it is just following instructions and adding ingredients. You can practice this regularly as it would provide you with authentic Indian curry in the cheapest price abroad.
